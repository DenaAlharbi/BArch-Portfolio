    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <h2><strong>Location:</strong> Emirates, Abu Dhabi</h2>
    <h2><strong>Area:</strong> 450 m²</h2>
    <h2><strong>Project Definition:</strong><br>
        This villa blends Emirati tradition with modern sustainability.<br>
        Its design centers on privacy and comfort, with separate guest and family zones.<br>
        A central courtyard enhances light, ventilation, and serenity.<br>
        Elements like perforated façades, wind catchers, and local materials connect the villa to its desert
        context.<br>
        More than a house, it’s a space that breathes, belongs, and reflects its cultural identity.
